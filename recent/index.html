            <h2>Red Paper Heart</h2>
            <p>I am currently the lead developer at Red Paper Heart. We design and build playful, inspiring interactive installations that are full of wonder. Our process relies on designers and developers working closely together from initial concept all the way through installation. We work in a wide range of technologies and begin every project with exploratory prototyping to help us determine what types of tools and media will best support our creative approach. We also often build our own tools to help us design and realize our projects, things like VR or AR previsualizations and configurable generative graphics systems. Iteration is a large part of our process, we are continually moving from design to technology and back to design. Each informing the other until the technology disappears into the background creating those playful wonderful moments.
            <p>Here is a selection of projects I have worked on with the studio.
