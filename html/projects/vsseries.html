				<p>For my final thesis at MCAD I created a set of four projects exploring the relationships between data, money, and media. The first project, Recursion vs Consumption, was a data visualization of months of my checking account activity using forks stuck in a wall. The visualization was plotted across the wall over time, each fork represented 3 dollars and each withdrawal removed forks from the wall while deposits added forks.
				<p>The second project, Module vs Interval, was an attempt to collect and document one million dollars of my own money. It involved withdrawing one thousand dollars at a time taking it home and documenting it and then redepositing it back into my account. Being a student, I barely had $1500 in my account so withdrawing $1000 at a time was the most I could hope for. I never reached one million, but I did document around $60,000 worth of my own money.
				<p>The third and fourth projects were more abstract and performance based, they also lack proper documentation. In one project, I read aloud from a bible while I whited out the words. I forget exactly what my argument was there. Something about making words have a finite use. Also it was a bible, so there. The last project was a tiny projection of my active credit card number in a public space. But as someone attempted to get close and read it, it would get even smaller until it was illegible.
