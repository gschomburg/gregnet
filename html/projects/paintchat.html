				<p>Words Can Hurt You was a live stream video chat room and system for firing a paintball gun over the internet. At the time it was created (~2004), live video streaming was still a rare sight on the internet. The recently released Macromedia Flash Communication Server allowed Flash applications fairly easy integration with live video and chatroom features.
				<p>Interfacing a computer, website, and paintball gun was a much more difficult challenge that I had no idea how to accomplish. Arduinos were just being invented at the time, and physical computing projects relied on a mix of ad-hoc solutions. Luckily, paintball guns have a fairly simple electronic switch for a trigger; I was able to wire the trigger up to a photodiode light sensor which I taped to the screen of a CRT monitor. The sensor was placed over a black square drawn on the screen by software that monitored the chat server. When someone sent a message, the webpage would blink the black square and the gun would fire.
