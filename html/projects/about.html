				<p>Hi, my name is Greg. I am a creative coder with a background in art and design. I have been designing and developing interactive experiences and installations for the past fifteen years. Over the course of my career, I've had the opportunity to work with a wide range of technologies, languages, and frameworks. My current focus is Unity and C# development for virtual and augmented reality experiences. I am currently looking for interesting projects where I can best utilize my talents.
				<p>I received my BFA from The Minneapolis College of Art and Design. I studied interactive media, but I also took standard art school foundation classes for design, photography, illustration and sculpture. While attending school I also worked for a local studio called Ham in the Fridge developing flash games and websites. In 2007 I moved to New York City to work for The Studio for Interactive Media. There, I designed and developed interactive installations and media. We built websites, kiosks, circuit prototypes, installations and computer vision software. After TSFIM I worked for Brand New School â€” a film and design studio, not a school. At BNS I designed and developed large screen based installations and events. Currently, I am freelancing in NYC and looking for opportunities to work on interactive experiences and installations.
